        <h2>Interests and Projects</h2>
        <p>I have a strong interest in business analytics, data-driven decision-making, and uncovering meaningful 
            trends in complex datasets. My passion lies in using data science techniques to solve real-world 
            problems, whether in business operations, environmental policy, or scientific research. </p>

          <p>  Recently, I have worked on projects spanning multiple domains. One of my key analyses focused 
            on vehicle emissions, where I compared the lifetime emissions of internal combustion engine (ICE),
             plug-in hybrid (PHEV), and battery electric (BEV) vehicles. This project involved modeling emissions
            across manufacturing, fueling, and end-of-life phases, incorporating statistical adjustments for 
            vehicle lifetime using functions like the Weibull distribution. </p>

            <p> I also explored renewable energy adoption strategies, evaluating the trade-offs between 
            investing in electric vehicle infrastructure and renewable energy sources based on regional
             budgets and energy grid compositions. This analysis aimed to optimize resource allocation 
            for maximum environmental benefit. </p>
            
             <p>Beyond environmental analytics, I have conducted image analysis in a lab setting,
            working with models in Python to track the movement of microscopic organisms. 
            This involved refining models to improve accuracy in detecting small features and identify
            trends in behavior and expression.
            
            <p> Across these projects, I have developed a strong foundation in data analysis, 
            statistical modeling, and machine learning, applying these skills to generate insights 
            that drive strategic decision-making.
