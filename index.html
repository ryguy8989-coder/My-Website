        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Ryan Jiang, and I’m a fourth-year Economics and Mathematics major with a minor in
        Data Science at Northeastern University. Throughout my time at Northeastern, I have developed
        a strong passion for analyzing data and solving complex problems, which has shaped my academic 
        and career pursuits. </p>

        <p> For my first co-op, I worked at SYSO Technologies, an energy startup that focuses on solar 
        battery management. This role gave me valuable experience in the renewable energy sector, where
         I worked on projects aimed at optimizing energy storage and distribution. It was an incredible
        opportunity to apply my analytical skills in a real-world setting and learn more about the 
        intersection of technology and sustainability.</p>

        <p>In my second co-op, I joined Wayfair’s Outlet Launch and Scale Team. At Wayfair, I focused on
        data analysis and operations management, helping to improve the company’s online sales 
        processes. The fast-paced environment and focus on data-driven decision-making gave me a 
        deeper understanding of how analytics can drive business growth and efficiency.</p>

        <p>Outside of my studies and co-ops, I’m passionate about sports, especially basketball, 
        and enjoy staying active through hiking and running. These activities help me maintain 
        a healthy balance and give me a chance to unwind and recharge.</p>
